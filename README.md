# Ruby Art Gallery Project

Functional website for a fake art gallery called _source room_. A full stack web app with **no javascript ðŸ˜²!!!** 

Full CRUD functionality w/ seperate views for visitors. N.B. there is no admin authentication - it's all just make believe.

Built w/ Ruby, Sinatra + a PSQL DB.

I did this to familiarise myself with Ruby and get better at CSS during two (seperate) working weeks in 2019 / 2020.
